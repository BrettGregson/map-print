Print a map of roads on a mug.

## Why?

I love maps and travels. Every time I grab a Vancouver mug - not only it is filled with hot coffee,
it is also filled with warm memories. 

Now you too can make a mug from the roads network of a city that you've visited (or planning to visit).
Or give it as a gifed to those whom you care about. I hope you like what this project does.

I'm giving away the entire source code for free. Yet I think you should know: with every purchase 
coming from this project, Zazzle gives me a small revenue from the sale. 
So every purchase supports this project.

Your ideas and suggestions are more than welcomed!

## Local Development

Get the package and its dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/anvaka/map-print.git
npm install
cd map-print
```

And then start the local server:

```
npm start
```

This should open a server on http://localhost:8080
